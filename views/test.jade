            h2.sub-heading Decide If you want Horizontal or Vertical Navigation.
            |   
            p
              | What most people don't know is that a little more than a decade ago Vertical Navigation bar was far more popular than Horizontal Navigation bars. Web design was easy. There were no dropdowns menus, depth or categories for pages. A client would give you 7 to 8 pages and the designer would simply line them up vertically on the home and that was it.
            |   
            p
              | As the world changes and the World Wide Web got more sophisticated,   individual websites also become more complex. Instead of the 8 pages most websites use to have; now websites will easily go over 20 pages of content. Listing every single page in a Vertical Navigation simply wasn't going to cut it. This force web designer to really think deeply about their design and learned to properly architect all the contents in an organized fashion. And in many ways a Horizontal bar was simply better than the traditional Vertical Navigation bar.
            |   
            p
              | Fast track to today... Many professional web designer still argue furiously over wither Horizontal Navigation is better or Vertical Navigation is better. While there great companies who still make very good use of Vertical Navigations such as Walmart and Amazon, it is pretty clear that most websites favorites the Horizontal Navigation bar.
            |   
            p
              | My person opinion is this: if you have a few pages then both Horizontal and Vertical would work. If you have a lot of pages and content with multiple level of depth then Horizontal with dropdown is more intuitive to users. But if you want to build an ecommerce with a lot of categories and you want the user to be able to visually see all the top categories right away then Vertical or a combination of both would be a great choice.

            p
              | For most businesses 4 to 5 core pages and maybe a blog is all they're ever going to need for a website.
              | However, we've worked with companies (Usually Professional firms or Retailers with a lot of products) that have hundreds of pages and dozens of categories.
            |   
            p
              | For example: A law firm may want to have a home, about, team, practice area, media, FAQ, blog, careers and many more pages on their navigation.
              | That is 8 different button on their main navigation, and that is a lot. You'll not only run out of room to display everyone of them on your main navigation bar, but it can also be overwhelming to your clients.
            |   
            p
              | A good practice is to plan a head and design a navigation flow. Amazon does an exceptional job at their navigation flow.
              | If you visit Amazon.com you see button &quot;Shop by Department&quot;, then you get a drop down menu of all the categories and sub-categories.
              | It is well organized and intuitive to the their user.
            |   
            p
              | A great tool that you can use to visualize your navigation flow is to use a tree diagram. This way you'll know exactly what page links to what and what category each page belongs to.

              | Homepage is going to be the one of most important page for your business website.
              | In my opinion the purpose of your homepage is to connect and tell your audiences what you're about.
              | For example: if you visit Apples website their homepage is almost always a huge HD pictures of their current hottest products and nothing else.
              | That is because Apple is all about the next hot product and their home page demonstrates exactly that.
            |   
            p
              | There are many ways to structure your homepage, some business uses videos, some has lots of pictures, and some business uses their blog as their homepage.
              | But as a good rule to follow for homepages, is to keep it simple. The best homepages we have seen are not jam-packed with informations.
              | Think about how you're going to layout your homepage. What content and information do you want to show your audience.

            h2.sub-heading Decide How Many Contact Form your Website Needs.
            |   
            p
              | Most companies we have worked with needed a contact form of some sort.
              | Wither it is to get a quote request, consulting request, or to get feedbacks from customer, contact forms are a vital part of many businesses. Yet, we are always amazed at how horrible and complicated some of the contact forms that are out there. It is very simple. The more complicated a form appears the less likely the user will fill it out.
            |   
            p
              | Also, if you're planning to implement multiple contact forms in different positions of your website.
              | Make sure to ask your developers to implement a way to keep track of which form the user used to submit his information.
              | This is little trick help many of our clients increase conversion simply by testing and moving the position of the contact form.
          section
            h2.sub-heading Write down a List of Functions your Website Needs.
            |   
            p
              | One of the biggest mistakes business owners makes when creating their website is to add features and functionalities after the website has been completed.
              | As developers we can tell you nothing kills more time and money then a client coming to as and say &quot;oh I want to add this to our website.&quot; one month after we've completed the site.
            |   
            p
              | Anytime a new feature is added to the website, we must make sure that it is congruent and that it doesn't introduce new problems to the existing site.
              | All that requires time to implement and test. While it is inevitable for business to make changes to their website as they grow.
              | It is best for business owners to think and plan ahead, this will guranatee to save you money and time.

            h2.sub-heading Create a Mock-up of your Website.
            |   
            p
              | Most websites never go through the mock-up phase, which is very unfortunate. In the website development process Mock-ups are called wireframes. Wireframes can either be draw by hand or created digitally using applications such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator.
            |   
            p
              | Wireframes are usually black and white with no fancy graphics or images. The only real goal of creating wireframes is to architect the Structure
              | and flow of the website and it's content.
            |   
            p
              | Using mock-ups or wireframes to plan your website will give you and your website developer a much clearer picture of how the website should look like once completed. As a result there will be less guessing, shorter development period, and more money back into your pocket.

            p
              | To most people the idea of having a &ldquo;Responsive&rdquo; web design means mobile friendly, but what they don't realize is that there are actually two ways to make your site mobile friendly and Responsive is only one of them.
              | Adaptive design is also a process of making your site mobile friendly but it is rarely talked about in the main stream. All Responsive designs can also be considered to be Adaptive but the reverse is not true. Allow me to explain.
            |   
            p
              | Adaptive design is targeted modification of your website to specifically fit for certain screen sizes that you want to target such as iPhone 4, iPhone 5, iPad, Samsung Note 3, etc&mldr; Where as Responsive designs are more fluid with set break points. Another way to understand this is that Responsive design will scale accordingly as the screen size changes but Adaptive will only change to certain amount of specified screen sizes.
            |   
            p
              | whether you should use an Adaptive approach or Responsive approach is purely base on the purpose of your site. If you know most of your users are going to use only desktop and say iPhone 5 then using the Adaptive approach will save you a lot of time and money. But chances are it is hard to predict what your users are going to use with dozens of different smart phones and tablets out there. In my opinion in most cases Responsive design is usually the better choice.

              | - There are 3 types of hosting that most hosting companies will offer.
              |     Shared hosting, Virtual Private hosting, and Dedicated private hosting.
              |     Shared is hosting is the cheapest, that is because your website will be sharing resources with hundreds of other website on the same server.
              |     Hence the name Shared hosting. Virtual Private hosting is the most idea for smaller businesses.
              |     Unlike Share hosting, Virtual Private hosting allocates a specific amount of resources from a physical server in a virtual environment just for your website.
              |     Dedicated private hosting is the most expensive, but you get your own physical server and 100% of the resources all to yourself.
              |     Ideal for larger websites with huge traffic.

              | - Most web-hosting provider will guarantee you 99% uptime, but 1% of 365 days is 3 and half days of time.
              |     The 3 days might seem small but if you rely on your website to generate revenue, 3 days of down time can cost you a lot.
              |     Look for hosting provider who guarantee 99.9% uptown, the 0.9% uptime come at a higher upfront cost but it's worth it.

              | - Some hosting provider will promise you unlimited Bandwidth, and in most cases unlimited Bandwidth is never really unlimited.
              |     Unlimited bandwidth usually comes with slow speed, and the speed of your site is a big ranking factor for Google. Look for a provider with reasonable Bandwidth for your traffic load.
